# Codex Run Memory

Purpose: persistent implementation memory across chats/loops for this repository.

Rules:
- Keep entries short and durable.
- Record only useful engineering learnings (snags, decisions, caveats, reusable checks).
- Do not store secrets, credentials, tokens, or personal data.
- Avoid duplicates; update/apply prior entries when relevant.

Template:
```md
### YYYY-MM-DD <context>
- Situation:
- Learning:
- Action/Decision:
- Reusable check/command:
- Applicability:
```
